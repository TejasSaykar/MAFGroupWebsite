                The pricing of Google Cloud Hosting plans is decent as they are
                cheaper than hosting plans offered by other platforms. Google
                Cloud Hosting also offers per sec billing plans. The
                subscription never binds a person as they can stop it anytime,
                they want. In Google Cloud Hosting, no upfront cost is needed,
                so you are never required to pre-pay. Google also offers a
                lucrative discount on all its services.
