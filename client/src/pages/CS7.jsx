                  As with all projects, we did a thorough assessment of the
                  clientâ€™s existing infrastructure, outlined key deficiencies
                  and opportunities for improvement. The implementation of an
                  Elastic Search System which was renowed for its scalability
                  and efficiency in large datasets was proposed thus laying down

                  We concurrently worked on Attribution Modeling that unraveled
                  the intricate customer journey and how effectively they
                  communicated with each touchpoint. By leveraging Multi-Channel
                  Funnel (MCF), we generated reports by collecting data from
                  multiple applications and gained insights into customer
                  conversion pathways. This invaluable information was then
                  utilized efficiently to enable appropriate resourceallocation.
