            </h2>
            <p className="text-xl font-light">
              Our client wanted to expand their possibilities and migrate to a
              platform that was more dynamic and suited their changing
              requirements. We did an in-depth analysis of their needs and
              suggested migrating to Salesforce and this is how the
              transformation process unfolded.

              Our Solution:
            </h2>
            <p className="text-xl font-light">
              We helped them navigate through uncharted territory by carefully
              migrating from Magento 2 to Salesforce Commerce Cloud (SFCC) and
              Salesforce Marketing Cloud (SFMC) to embrace the dynamic
              capabilities of Salesforce.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl font-light">
              In addition to managing the Salesforce platform, we additionally
              crafted bespoke applications that catered to their organizational
              needs while working in perfect harmony between the SFCC and SFMC.
            </p>

            <p className="text-xl font-light">
              We additionally ventured into data convergence, by connecting
              their disparate data sources into the BigQuery and intricately
              feeding them into S3 to create a robust data infrastructure. The
              data was then fed into Power BI to curate reports that helped our
              client analyse trends and prepare for opportunities.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl font-light">
              This harmonious transformation involving migration, bespoke
              applications and cohesive datasets paved the way for our clientâ€™s
              digital future.
