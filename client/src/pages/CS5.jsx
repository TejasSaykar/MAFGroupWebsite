              Our client wanted to expand their possibilities and migrate to a
              platform that was more dynamic and suited their changing
              requirements. We did an in-depth analysis of their needs and
              suggested migrating to Salesforce and this is how the
              transformation process unfolded.

                  We helped them navigate through uncharted territory by
                  carefully migrating from Magento 2 to Salesforce Commerce
                  Cloud (SFCC) and Salesforce Marketing Cloud (SFMC) to embrace
                  the dynamic capabilities of Salesforce.

                <p className="font-light">
                  In addition to managing the Salesforce platform, we
                  additionally crafted bespoke applications that catered to
                  their organizational needs while working in perfect harmony
                  between the SFCC and SFMC.

              We additionally ventured into data convergence, by connecting
              their disparate data sources into the BigQuery and intricately
              feeding them into S3 to create a robust data infrastructure. The
              data was then fed into Power BI to curate reports that helped our
              client analyse trends and prepare for opportunities.

            <p className="font-light">
              This harmonious transformation involving migration, bespoke
              applications and cohesive datasets paved the way for our clientâ€™s
              digital future.
