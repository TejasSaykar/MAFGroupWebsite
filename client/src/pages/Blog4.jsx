              What is Digital Transformation?
            </h3>
            <p className="font-light text-lg">
              If you aren’t aware of it, digital transformation simply refers to
              how well an organization has adopted new digital technologies in
              its operations to accelerate growth, boost profits and simplify
              processes. It’s also an ongoing process, not a one-off event. It
              helps organizations get an edge over competitors and optimally
              enhance their operations.

                To retain customer trust, businesses must ensure that their data

                reserve funds for cybersecurity. The vital data must be
                encrypted, and employees and customers should know about proper
                data management. Businesses must also prepare for and have
                action plans for cyber-attacks or data breach attempts.

              </h3>
              <p className="text-lg font-light">
                Companies and their clients should be able to access the work
                via the internet. It is done via cloud computing, which reduces
                the need to purchase and maintain onsite hardware. Cloud
                solutions let a business enhance collaboration, be more
                flexible, and accelerate digital transformation. Most
                forward-thinking businesses are not depending on a single cloud
                solution. Instead, they are utilizing multiple clouds.
                Hybrid-cloud solutions are also gaining a lot of popularity.
